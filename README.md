# Passenger Counting App 🚶‍♂️

## Description
I started to learn JavaScript on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home) and this is the 1st part of the course.
It's just simply a way to count by pressing a button and saving it and resetting the count by pressing another button.

## Live Version
You can view the live version of the project here: [Live Demo](https://robinsrepository.github.io/passenger-counter/)
